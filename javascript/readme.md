This folder contains the javascript used to edit the display of contents notes in the Primo VE front end. There are two files, one is the main script, the other shows a fragment of the custom.module.js file that calls the main script.
I would stress two strings, which are probably obvious anyway:
  1. I am very definitely an amateur at javascript and probably others could achieve the object of this script much better.
  2. The script is a pragmatic attempt to deal with 505 data that is variously formatted. Sometimes it will fall down, but in most cases it seems to improve upon the display.
