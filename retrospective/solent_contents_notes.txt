The extremes and eccentricities of the founding father of the modern advertising industry, revealed through interviews with those who knew and worked with him, plus exclusive access to his archive. Surrey-born David Ogilvy fed dreams with famous campaigns and slogans. This profile charts his journey from apprentice chef to copywriting colossus: his agency began in 1948 with no clients and two members of staff, and became the largest advertising conglomerate in the world. In time, this would become the era of the Mad Men, the men of Madison Avenue who worked out of sleek offices, chain-smoked and conjured up the heaven-on-earth vision of suburban consumer splendour.

The man who trained the Bali bombers has turned his back on terrorism and is working with police. His extraordinary story is told here. Taylor visits South East Asia to explore how the region has fought Al-Qaeda's allies and those responsible for twice bombing Bali. Nasir Abas has rejected terrorism to inform on his former comrades, give evidence against them in court and try to persuade them to change sides. He has become a devastating new weapon in the war against Al-Qaeda's affiliates: but will others follow?

Carl has served nearly 30 years for murder: he claims training hawks in prison has made him a changed man. Can the Parole Board trust his transformation? Paul, serving life for slashing strangers across the face, will never get out unless he proves he's no longer a danger.

The people of Santa Lucia (a farming community on the slopes of the Andes) were forced to abandon their traditional way of life because of laws brought in to protect the cloud forest where they live. Instead they set out to build an eco-lodge for tourists. Against the odds, and exploiting the internet, they have started on the hard road towards establishing their business. But can they turn eco-tourism into a real business? With no money for advertising, how will they market their holidays when tourism is so competitive? Will they survive? Various aspects of the project are examined. Before, they were destroyers of the forest; now they have learned the skills of conservation and sustainability. The lodge is a stunning place, a treasurehouse of bio-diversity but is it just a drop in the ocean: eco-tourism is seen as the model for sustainable tourism, but how can projects like this make a difference when so much of the rain forests are still being destroyed?

She has, however, also consistently produced works dealing in other media, including digital and moving image technology. Her work addresses the mediated forms of observation offered by optical and image-based technologies and central to her practice is an interest in and investigation of the social, historical, physical and psychological spaces we inhabit as viewers. The work focuses on the fine line between fact and fiction via the subject of landscape from a contemporary perspective, the ideas that grew out of a process of collecting images and concepts of predominantly Northern European Romantic ideas. The DVD includes her reflecting upon the ideas and processes that inform her work; a selection of sculptural and video installation works, and the booklet includes an illustrated essay by Francis McKee

9997034348904796	$$aChapter 1: Accustoming Yourself to C++   1: View C++ as a federation of languages.    2: Prefer consts, enums, and inlines to defines.   3: Use const whenever possible.   4: Make sure that objects are initialized before they’re used.  Chapter 2: Constructors, Destructors, and Assignment Operators   5: Know what functions C++ silently writes and calls.   6: Explicitly disallow the use of compiler-generated functions you do not want.   7: Declare destructors virtual in polymorphic base classes.   8: Prevent exceptions from leaving destructors.   9: Never call virtual functions during construction or destruction.   10: Have assignment operators return a reference to *this.   11: Handle assignment to self in operator=.   12: Copy all parts of an object. Chapter 3: Resource Management   13: Use objects to manage resources.   14: Think carefully about copying behavior in resource-managing classes.   15: Provide access to raw resources in resource-managing classes.   16: Use the same form in corresponding uses of new and delete.   17: Store newed objects in smart pointers in standalone statements. Chapter 4: Designs and Declarations   18: Make interfaces easy to use correctly and hard to use incorrectly.   19: Treat class design as type design.   20: Prefer pass-by-reference-to-const to pass-by-value.   21: Don’t try to return a reference when you must return an object.   22: Declare data members private.   23: Prefer non-member non-friend functions to member functions.   24: Declare non-member functions when type conversions should apply to all parameters.   25: Consider support for a non-throwing swap. Chapter 5: Implementations   26: Postpone variable definitions as long as possible.   27: Minimize casting.   28: Avoid returning “handles” to object internals.   29: Strive for exception-safe code.   30: Understand the ins and outs of inlining.   31: Minimize compilation dependencies between files. Chapter 6: Inheritance and Object-Oriented Design   32: Make sure public inheritance models “is-a.”   33: Avoid hiding inherited names.   34: Differentiate between inheritance of interface and inheritance of implementation.   35: Consider alternatives to virtual functions.   36: Never redefine an inherited non-virtual function.   37: Never redefine a function’s inherited default parameter value.   38: Model “has-a” or “is-implemented-in-terms- of” through composition.   39: Use private inheritance judiciously.   40: Use multiple inheritance judiciously. Chapter 7: Templates and Generic Programming   41: Understand implicit interfaces and compile-time polymorphism.   42: Understand the two meanings of typename.   43: Know how to access names in templatized base classes.   44: Factor parameter-independent code out of templates.   45: Use member function templates to accept “all compatible types.”   46: Define non-member functions inside templates when type conversions are desired.   47: Use traits classes for information about types.   48: Be aware of template metaprogramming. Chapter 8: Customizing new and delete   49: Understand the behavior of the new-handler.   50: Understand when it makes sense to replace new and delete.   51: Adhere to convention when writing new and delete.   52: Write placement delete if you write placement new. Chapter 9: Miscellany   53: Pay attention to compiler warnings.   54: Familiarize yourself with the standard library, including TR1.   55: Familiarize yourself with Boost.

Despite many visitors, little money ends up with local people. The holidays are organised by foreign tour operators and holiday makers spend their time in foreign-owned hotels. Even the food they eat is imported from abroad. There are also cultural and social problems and unemployed Gambian boys are tempted into begging money from tourists. How are Gambians trying to tackle these problems; is community tourism (getting people to spend money locally) the best hope for the future?

His access provides a lively, witty and insightful account of the highs and lows of this creative process, and demonstrates the great skill and craft required to execute the designs. Observance of old dressmaker lore is on the rise, along with the stress levels and chocolate consumption. On a farm outside Paris lives Mme Pouzieux, Chanel's celebrated braid-maker, whose incomprehensible loom has defied many a would-be apprentice. However, the hay harvest is not yet in, so haute couture will have to wait. (Also available as a Digital Video).

990069248830204796	$$aProfessor Richard Dawkins, Chair of the Public Understanding of Science at Oxford and world-renowned evolutionary biologist, is no stranger to controversy. In this contentious series, he describes God as the most unpleasant fictional character of all and launches a wholehearted attack on religion as the cause for much of the pain and suffering in the world. In part one, he confronts the march of militant religious belief and dismisses faith as an indulgence of irrationality that is nourishing extremism, division and terror. In part two, he focuses on what he sees as the harmful indoctrination of the young. He inveighs against the rise of faith schools in Britain and argues that religious education saddles children with falsehoods and an inflexible moral outlook.

Sewell reaches the southernmost point of his journey at the Greek site of Paestum, an intact public building from 500BC. Returning north, he passes Orvieto and the early Renaissance town of Todi. He also visits Urbino (birthplace of Raphael) and the palazzo that exiled Stuart James III stayed in as the Pope's guest

990069652450204796	$$aThis series visits homes that are examples of leading British architectural styles from the last century. It examines their design and construction, and sees how people live in buildings once at the cutting edge of design and now regarded as masterpieces. Here, The Firs in Hampstead, north London, designed in the late 1950s by Patrick Gwynne
990069630800204796	$$aAlain de Botton (author of `The architecture of happiness') seeks answers to the current housing crisis, examines how houses can affect our well-being, and offers suggestions for creating the perfect home. He argues most new houses are built in appalling tastes, and with a deficit of around a million homes, this country urgently needs to wake up to the merits of good design. If we learned to build more attractive dwellings, we might stand a higher chance of achieving happiness. (Also available as a Digital Video).

Design patterns are repeatable, reusable parts of the interface, from the concrete and functional (like buttons and text fields) to the more descriptive (like iconography styles, colors, and typography). Patterns interconnect, and together they form the language of your product’s interface. Shared practices are how we choose to create, capture, share and use those patterns by following a set of principles, or by keeping a pattern library. Chapter 1: Design Systems Chapter 2: Design Principles Chapter 3: Functional Patterns Chapter 4: Perceptual Patterns Chapter 5: Shared Language PART 2: PROCESS A design system cannot be built overnight – it evolves gradually with your product. But there are certain principles and practices that we can follow to make sure the system develops in the right direction and provide us some degree of control over it. The second part of the book focuses on practical steps and techniques to establish and maintain a design system, including planning the work; conducting an interface inventory; setting up a pattern library; creating, documenting, evolving and maintaining design patterns. Chapter 6: Parameters Of Your System Chapter 7: Planning And Practicalities Chapter 8: Systemizing Functional Patterns Chapter 9: Systemizing Perceptual Patterns Chapter 10: Pattern Libraries Conclusion.

990058126900204796	$$aTwo programmes on the impact of the animal liberation movement on business and politics. `Power and propaganda': the animal business is the world's largest industry and organisations on both sides of the debate use celebrities and propaganda to further their cause eg a great deal of media attention was created in the 70s when Brigitte Bardot was photographed with baby seals. The PETA organisation is at the forefront in the USA and its success in attracting financial support has led to its branching out into other countries, especially Europe. However, those who lost out are fighting back eg major fashion designers are re-adopting fur (and Naomi Campbell quickly swapped sides from being part of an anti-fur campaign to treading the catwalk again), the seal culling industry of Canada has new foreign markets and English mink breeders have moved their farms to Denmark to dodge forthcoming legislation. Campaigners in turn are stepping up their efforts by aiming at new targets eg PETA has begun a war on its own turf as the USA is the world's largest consumer of meat. `Political animals': over the past 30 years, animal-rights and welfare groups have forced issues of cruelty and exploitation onto the political agenda and into the statute book. Some people, however, think animal rights are being put above those of man. (Also available as a Digital Video).

The real costs are higher still - wasted time, lost business, lost jobs, ruined reputations, injury and death. But many incidents attributed to human error are in fact accidents waiting to happen. This video features dramatic scenarios of: ship collision, cargo loss, personal injury, pollution, property damage. It shows how to look beyond the `active failures' (the immediate causes of incidents) to identify the `latent failures' (the root causes), often overlooked. It helps mariners and shore staff avoid incidents by predicting when and where they will occur. This DVD is produced by the world's largest mutual marine insurer, the UK P&I Club

9997157349504796	$$aTo remain unconsumed by consumer society—this was the goal, pursued through a world of subtle and practical means, that beckoned throughout the first volume of The Practice of Everyday Life. The second volume of the work delves even deeper than did the first into the subtle tactics of resistance and private practices that make living a subversive art. Michel de Certeau, Luce Giard, and Pierre Mayol develop a social history of “making do” based on microhistories that move from the private sphere (of dwelling, cooking, and homemaking) to the public (the experience of living in a neighborhood). A series of interviews—mostly with women—allows us to follow the subjects’ individual routines, composed of the habits, constraints, and inventive strategies by which the speakers negotiate daily life. Through these accounts the speakers, “ordinary” people all, are revealed to be anything but passive consumers. Amid these experiences and voices, the ephemeral inventions of the “obscure heroes” of the everyday, we watch the art of making do become the art of living.This long-awaited second volume of de Certeau’s masterwork, updated and revised in this first English edition, completes the picture begun in volume 1, drawing to the last detail the collective practices that define the texture, substance, and importance of the everyday.Michel de Certeau (1925-1986) wrote numerous books that have been translated into English, including Heterologies (1986), The Capture of Speech (1998), and Culture in the Plural (1998), all published by Minnesota. Luce Giard is senior researcher at the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique and is affiliated with the Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales, Paris. She is visiting professor of history and history of science at the University of California, San Diego. Pierre Mayol is a researcher in the French Ministry of Culture in Paris.Timothy J. Tomasik is a freelance translator pursuing a Ph.D. in French literature at Harvard University.

Features the work of Russian artist and photographer Aleksandr Rodchenko - during Stalin's Great Terror he was forced to doctor books he himself had created by blacking out the faces of the subjects within. Also, German-born August Sander's 1929 book of portraits `Faces of our time' came back to haunt him as its images didn't conform to the Nazi idea of a Master Race, so the book was banned and templates destroyed. (Also available as a Digital Video).

Its technical content is laid out in six Annexes, the first five of which were adopted by the 1973 Convention, as modified by a 1978 Protocol. These Annexes cover pollution of the sea by oil, by noxious liquid substances in bulk, by harmful substances in packaged form, by sewage from ships, and by garbage from ships. Annex VI was adopted by a further Protocol in 1997 and covers air pollution from ships.The 2022 consolidated edition aims to provide an easy and comprehensive reference to the up-to-date provisions and Unified Interpretations of the Articles, Protocols and Annexes of the MARPOL Convention, including the incorporation of all the amendments that have been adopted by the Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC).

The transition from silent films to `talkies', coupled with the rapid rise and fall of matinee idols and insatiable media interest in their off-screen antics, made for a torrid time between the late 1920s and the start of the Second World War. Matthew Sweet tells the story of the most breathless, chaotic and scandalous decade of British film history: the 1930s, when the new 'talkies' blasted silent pictures into oblivion. The 1927 Cinematography Films Act boosted the British film industry and studios sprang up, including Ealing, Shepperton and Elstree. With the introduction of 'talkies', stars were born and destroyed and the increasingly curious media began to appreciate that celebrity scandals sold newspapers.

Robot Revolution: Experiments have transformed machines into creatures with consciousness; elsewhere, scientists are enhancing humans with synthetic parts that work better than the real thing. The result: a not-too distant world where man and Cheating Time: Advances in medical science are making aging, sickness, and potentially even death avoidable conditions. Replacing God: Could God's long reign be in jeopardy? Advances are affording humans a power once reserved for only the Almighty--the ability to create life. But as we manipulate DNA and produce new species to our whim, will we find God's shoes too big to fill? Galactic Pioneers: 21st Century explorers have set sail on an age of discovery that eclipses anything dreamed of by Columbus. Advances in propulsion technology, warp drive, and solar energy have allowed us to do what only science fiction writers dreamed possible until now. How to Be a Superhuman: Science stands at the brink of unlocking our primal instincts. Advancements in genetic engineering may soon free humans from the limitations that have linked us to the rest of the animal world. Pain, fear, uncertainty and fraily may be things of the past.

Infectious diseases are killers in both resource-rich and resource-poor countries Infections continue to emerge or re-emerge; Modern lifestyles and technical developments facilitate transmission of disease; What of the future?; The Approach Adopted in This Book; 1 The Adversaries Pathogens; 1 Pathogens as parasites; Introduction; Keywords; Introduction; The Varieties of Pathogens; Prokaryotes and eukaryotes; All organisms other than viruses and prions are made up of cells; Bacteria are prokaryotes; all other organisms are eukaryotes. Gram-negative bacteria have an outer lipopolysaccharide-rich layer Microparasites and macroparasites; Microparasites replicate within the host; Organisms that are small enough can live inside cells; Living Inside or Outside Cells; Pathogens within cells are protected from many of the host's defence mechanisms; Living outside cells provides opportunities for growth, reproduction and dissemination; Systems of Classification; Classification of bacteria and viruses; Correct identification of bacteria below the species level is often vital to differentiate pathogenic and non-pathogenic forms. Classification of viruses departs even further from the binomial system Classification assists diagnosis and the understanding of pathogenicity; 2 The bacteria; Introduction; Keywords; Introduction; Structure; Bacteria are 'prokaryotes' and have a characteristic cellular organization; Bacteria are classified according to their cell wall as Gram-positive or Gram-negative; Many bacteria possess flagella; Pili are another form of bacterial surface projection; Nutrition; Bacteria obtain nutrients mainly by taking up small molecules across the cell wall; All pathogenic bacteria are heterotrophic. Growth and Division A bacterial cell must duplicate its genomic DNA before it can divide; Replication must be accurate; Cell division is preceded by genome segregation and septum formation; Bacterial growth and division are important targets for antimicrobial agents; Gene Expression; Most genes are transcribed into messenger RNA (mRNA); Transcription; Transcription is initiated at promoters; Transcription usually terminates at specific termination sites; mRNA transcripts often encode more than one protein in bacteria; Translation

Many dismiss the scene's gory imagery and shock-rock posturing as grotesque pantomime, but the glorification of sickening subject matter (torture, rape, murder and necrophilia) has been implicated in violent crimes worldwide. In Italy, the formation of a Satanic cult by a group of metal fans resulted in at least four grisly killings. Was death metal the catalyst, or would these youngsters have committed their appalling crimes anyway? This programme hears the views of band members, fans and parents.

From acculturation to undocumented immigration, the authors consider more than three dozen concepts at the heart of migration studies. Clearly written in a highly readable style, the book is a valuable resource for students and scholars alike." - Nancy Foner, City University of New York "This very useful and authoritative compendium explicates thirty-eight concepts central to analysis of international migration. It is accessible to undergraduate students and even can enrich graduate courses. It nicely complements books like The Age of Migration or Exceptional People. Concision is a virtue!" - Mark J. Miller, University of Delaware This book provides lucid and intuitive explanations of the most important migration concepts as used in classrooms, among policymakers, and in popular and academic discourse. Arguing that there is a clear need for a better public understanding of migration, it sets out to clarify the field by exploring relevant concepts in a direct and engaging way. Each concept: Includes an easy to understand definition Provides real-world examples Gives suggestions for further reading Is carefully cross-referenced to other related concepts It is an ideal resource for undergraduate and post-graduate students studying migration in sociology, politics, development and throughout the social sciences, as well as scholars in the field and practitioners in governmental and non-governmental organizations.

We can talk about onto-epistemological uncertainties and pragmatic uncertainties of communication, about theoretical and practical uncertainties, and about primary and secondary uncertainties of communication. Uncertainties regarding the object of communication as autonomous discipline, the research methods of communication, the sources, paradigms and models of communication represent theoretical, onto-epistemological uncertainties. Pragmatic uncertainties include uncertainties in communication processes; they have a practical character. Pragmatic uncertainties are those that lead to communication failure and they consist in minor obstacles or insurmountable barriers in concrete communication.

The famous beige check has become the uniform of the so-called chav: the anti-social, downmarket lout pilloried in the tabloids. UK sales of Burberry have fallen, hit by the chav factor and by an increasing flood of counterfeit check on market stalls across the country. This programme analyses Burberry's image problems and looks at how they have been trying to fight back. (Also available as a Digital Video).

Each one contributes their own perspective on the growing interest topic of subjective well-being. The aim of the volume is to present these divergent perspectives and to foster communication between the different areas. Split into three parts, this volume initially discusses the general perspectives of subjective well-being and addresses fundamental questions, secondly it discusses the dynamics of subjective well-being and more specific research issues to give a better understanding of the general phenomenon, and thirdly the book emphasizes the social context in which people experience and report their happiness and satisfaction. The book will be of great interest to social and clinical psychologists, students of psychology and sociology and health professionals.

990071574600204796	$$aHistorian Mica Nava reveals how, in the early 20th century, Woolworths and Selfridges began a consumer revolution that changed the face of the high street and London's West End. In 1909, Gordon Selfridge offered up his emporium in Oxford Street as a new social space for Edwardian women keen to escape the restrictions of the past century. Frank Woolworth raised shoppers' aspirations in Liverpool when he opened the first store in England in 1909: offering mass-manufactured goods at low, fixed prices. Today Selfridges and Woolworths are part of the British shopping landscape; in the early 1900s they were two flashy new stores founded by American entrepreneurs who wanted to teach the English how to shop for pleasure - introducing the idea of shopping for pleasure rather than for necessity.

Remove any one and business becomes impossible but labour is the most important as it controls the other two. The quality of labour (ie people) decides whether the right decisions are made and decisions are affected by people's behaviour. Behaviour also affects how individuals interact and are perceived by others; when behaviour becomes a problem, then problems arise. This video examines human interaction and offers positive guidelines to ensure relationships remain harmonious. The objectives are: to clarify the assumptions made and beliefs held about behaviour; to identify specific behaviours that help and hinder every interaction; to develop an action plan to help people respond positively in future interactions
