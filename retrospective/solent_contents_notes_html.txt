These subjects are discussed as theories developed in a variety of disciplines and through case studies that emphasise a range of cultural practices, including popular music, literature, tourism, and oral performances. </p> <p> The case studies focus upon postcolonial Britain, India, the English-speaking Caribbean, Ireland, South Africa and Australasia. Three chapters discuss particular modes of cultural production and performance: music, film, dance, and the body cultures of dance and sports. The remaining three chapters deal with wider issues of memory, land, and alternative world-views.

Magical thinking. Fruits, not roots : the disastrous merger of big business and big green ; No messiahs : the green billionaires won't save us ; Dimming the sun : the solution to pollution is ... pollution? </li><li> Part III.

Blockadia : the new climate warriors ; Love will save this place : democracy, divestment, and the wins so far ; You and what army? : indigenous rights and the power of keeping our word ; Sharing the sky : the atmospheric commons and the power of paying our debts ; The right to regenerate : moving from extraction to renewal </li><li> Conclusion: The leap years : just enough time for impossible.
