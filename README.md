# marc505

This repository contains supporting material for my article about displaying 505 notes better in the library catalogue.

It contains
1. A folder showing Solent University's 505 notes as they originally were and after retrospective work had been applied.
2. A folder for the javascript that does all the changes in the Primo VE front end.
3. A folder giving all the data - stats, not record content - obtained from NBK.
