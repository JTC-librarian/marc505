# marc505

This repository contains supporting material for my research around the format and display of MARC 505 notes.
It contains
1. A directory containing the python scripts used to process the RDF files downloaded from the British National Bibliography and to get the data from the MARC files retrived from Jisc's Library Hub Cataloguing.
2. A directory for the javascript that does all the changes in the Primo VE front end.
